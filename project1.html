<h3>End Users</h3>
<h6> This charcter ive made is a characterdue to his unique personallity and appearnce which will attract alot of people. People who want to develop a story game 
  can use this character for either a side character or as a main character. This chracter will stand out to developers who want to make a chracter where one of the character has 
  a dark and boring personallity. Some general things game developers want in characters are that their code and appearance are functional which i can provide. Game developers 
  can do alot with this character for example giving it some character development to bring it out from its dark personallity.
